			<h1>My Page of Interests</h1>
			<p>For those who dare to risk boring themselves with bothering to get to know someone else's interests, this page was created with the sole purpose of conducting a programming exercise.</p>
			<p>That was the most immediate and pressing reason for it's construction.</p>
			<p>But fear not, despite the aforementioned reason, I hope I'm able to offer some relevant and enriching content for whoever feels like reading this to the very end.</p>
			<p>First of all, thanks for your time and I ask you to forgive any error found in this writing, English is not my mother language, but I felt that this page should be written in English, as I felt that maybe I'm going to be encouraged to share this exercise with my course's colleagues in the future and most of them must speak English in some degree.</p>

			<h2>Complete My First <em>Try It!</em>, By Creating a Personal Interests Page</h2>
			<p>That's pretty straightforward isn't it?</p>
			<p>The only thing is that I didn't want to use the CodePen, so I developed this page using Eclipse.</p>
		</div>
		<div>
			<h2>Complete My Second <em>Try It!</em>, By Formating Some Text in My Interests Page</h2>
			<p>I need to make some text bold, to emphasize some text (which I did by emphasizing the <em>Try It!</em> within the previous two headers and in this very same phrase) and nesting at least two pairs of formating tags.</p>
			<p>I don't know where I could apply bold in a consistent manner, so I'm going to quote a phrase of one of my favorite book:</p>
			<p><em>"The memory is just an illusion created by my mind to explain the discrepancies between my immediate physical sensations and my spirit state."</em></p>
			<p><b>- Douglas Adams, <em>The Hichhiker's Guide to the Galaxy</em></b></p>
			<em>
				<p><b>Note: </b>This quote is from one of the four books of the series (I don't remember exactly which one right now, sorry about that).</p>
				<p>Some might argue that the fourth book stands apart from the first three.</p>
				<p>This quote is certainly off, sorry about that, but I read the publications made in Brazilian Portuguese, I wrote it in the best way that I could remember it and translated it back to English with the help of Google Translator.</p>

			<h2>Complete My Third <em>Try It!</em>, By Adding Some Links and Images to My Personal Interests Page</h2>
			<p>Click this link to access the <a href="http://www.dukelearntoprogram.com" target="_blank">Duke Learn to Program</a> web page.</p>
			<p>If you are curious to know more about the <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/TAGS/tag_a.asp" target="_blank">HTML &lt;a&gt; Tag</a>, just hit the previous link to read more about it at the W3Schools web site.</p>
			<p>While I was searching at Wikimedia Commons web site for an image to include in my personal interests page, I found the below image, that was chosen as image of the day for 10th January 2024.</p>
			<p>Since I watched recently an anime named Pluto at Netflix, I decided to use this first image that were presented to me as soon as I accessed Wikimedia Commons web site, just because one of the robots in the previously mentioned anime were named Mont Blanc.</p>

Mottl, CC BY-SA 4.0 &lt;https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0&gt;, via Wikimedia Commons" href="https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Mont_Blanc_from_Les_Arcs_1950.jpg"><img alt="Mont Blanc from Les Arcs 1950" src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/7b/Mont_Blanc_from_Les_Arcs_1950.jpg/4096px-Mont_Blanc_from_Les_Arcs_1950.jpg"></a>
			<p>At Wikimedia Commons I found an option to <em><b>use this file</b> on the web</em> directly, so I decided to use this option.</p>
			<p>By doing so, I was presented with a few options, two of them were most important to me:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>An option to select the image width in pixels (being the 4096px the widest option available); and</li>
				<li>A text area titled <b><em>Embed this file</em></b>, that I used to get the link with the appropriate credits and a reference to the license already provided.</li>
			</ol>
			<p>For the extra challenge, I just changed the value provided for the <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/TAGS/att_img_width.asp" target="_blank"><em>width</em></a> attribute of the <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/TAGS/tag_img.asp" target="_blank"><em>HTML &lt;img&gt; Tag</em></a>, inserting a percent value o 100%, that relates to the width of the viewport of the browser.</p>
			<p>By doing so, the image has it's width automatically adjusted to fill the width of the browser's viewport.</p>
			<p>If you want to know more about the <em>HTML &lt;img&gt; tag</em> and it's <em>width</em> attribute, just follow the above links to the W3Schools web site.</p>

			<h2>Complete my Fourth <em>Try It!</em></h2>
			<p>This <em>Try It!</em> exercise consists of adding an unordered and an ordered list, plus creating a table and completing the extra challenge, that consists of nesting a list inside another one.</p>
			<p>I hope you like the results, despite this early learning stage and because of that the simplicity of this web page.</p>
			<p>To tell the truth, these <em>Try It!</em> exercises aren't hard to accomplish at all, the hardest thing actually is to decide on what contents that I want to add to my page.</p>
			<p>I'm going to take the exercises suggested statement as inspiration to create a nested list of top foods, books and movies.</p>
			<p>The original statement cited a top 5 list, but I won't make any promises on that so, there it goes:</p>
			<h3>My Rank of Top Favorites</h3>
			<ol>
				<li class="foodsLi">
					<h4>Top Favorite Foods (By Category)</h4>
					<ol>
						<li>
							<h5>Pastas</h5>
							<ol>
								<li>Lasagna with Bolognese Sauce;</li>
								<li>Penne pasta with Bolognese Sauce; and</li>
								<li>Fusilli pasta with Bolognese Sauce.</li>
							</ol>
							<em>
								<p><b>Note:</b> You're right! Bolognese sauce is a favorite of mine :-D</p>
								<p>But I also like to have my pasta with sugo sauce, sometimes mixed with the white sauce :-P</p>
								<p>And sometimes I like to mix the bolognese sauce with the white sauce too.</p>
								<p>To finalize this subject (at least for now :-P), almost always I like to have my pasta with grated cheese.</p>
							</em>
						</li>
						<li>
							<h5>Meats</h5>
							<ol>
								<li>A very juicy steak of filet mignon, fried with onion slices and tomatoes cut into cubes :-P</li>
								<li>Ancho steak, that would be a boneless rib eye roast according to Google; and</li>
								<li>A very much prized picanha barbecue, that would be roughly related to a sirloin cap with the fat cap still on.</li>
							</ol>
